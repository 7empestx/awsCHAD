## **Chad**:

So you want to harness the power of the ultimate "alpha male" in the AWS realm? Enter awsChadâ€”a kickstart repo so ripped, it scoffs at the mere mention of average stacks.

## **Frontend**:

**React with Webpack:** Forget those basic HTML templates. Real Chads craft their frontends using React and bundle their masterpieces with Webpack. Hosted straight from AWS S3's iron-clad gym and distributed with AWS Cloudfront's lightning-fast reflexes, this stack is the key to unlocking your frontend beast mode.

## **Backend**:

**TypeScript AWS Lambda:** Python and JavaScript? Too mainstream. Real Chads know that TypeScript brings the type safety and modern syntax that separates the men from the boys in the AWS Lambda dojo. Our API Gateway is so sharp, it triggers TypeScript functions like a Chad spotting the last protein shake on the shelf.

## Cloud Development Kit (CDK) Instructions:

**For successful operations with the CDK, you must perform two main commands provided your AWS credentials and IAM policies are configured accurately.**

1. Initiate a bootstrap process using the command `cdk bootstrap`. This action prepares your AWS environment for the deployment of the resources defined in your CDK application.
   
2. After bootstrapping, execute `cdk deploy --all` to deploy all the stacks in your CDK application to your AWS account. Ensure that your AWS credentials are in place and that the IAM policies grant the necessary permissions for the resources being deployed.
