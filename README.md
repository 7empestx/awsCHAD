## awsChad Deployment Guide:

This guide outlines the steps required for the seamless deployment of the awsChad project. Follow these prerequisites to prepare your environment:

1. **IAM User Configuration**:

    - Create an IAM user and generate access keys for CLI operations.
    - Create a policy and attach it to the user, ensuring to replace `<account-number>` with your actual AWS account number:
        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Sid": "CDKBootstrap",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "cloudformation:*",
                        "ecr:*",
                        "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                        "iam:GetRole",
                        "iam:CreateRole",
                        "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                        "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                        "iam:DeleteRole",
                        "iam:PassRole",
                        "ssm:*",
                        "s3:*"
                    ],
                    "Resource": [
                        "arn:aws:iam::<account-number>:*",
                        "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:<account-number>:*",
                        "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:<account-number>:*",
                        "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:<account-number>:*",
                        "arn:aws:s3:::*"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "Sid": "AWSPipelineSynth",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
                    "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        This policy facilitates the `cdk bootstrap` command. Exercise caution as this policy is expansive; tailor it to your project's security needs. Safeguard your access keys and never commit them to any repositories.
    - Generate HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit and attach the `AWSCodeCommitPowerUser` policy to your IAM user for repository access.

2. **AWS CLI Installation**:

    - Follow the [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) documentation to install the AWS CLI.
    - Run `aws configure` to set up your IAM user's credentials in the CLI environment.

3. **Domain Registration**:

    - Register a domain with Amazon Route 53, referring to the [Route 53 Domain Registration Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html) for comprehensive guidance.

4. **Local Environment Setup**:

    - Inside the `cdk` directory of your project, create a `.env` file and specify your Route 53 domain:
        ```
        DOMAIN_NAME="YourChosenRoute53Domain.com"
        ```
        Replace `YourChosenRoute53Domain.com` with the domain you've registered, which will be integral to your deployment.

5. **CodeCommit Repository Setup**:

    - In the `us-east-1` region, establish a CodeCommit repository named `awsChad`. Should you opt for a different name or region, realign your pipeline stack's configurations accordingly.
    - Link the CodeCommit repository as a remote to your local repository and push your awsChad project using the HTTPS Git credentials established earlier.

    - Should you encounter any challenges with inputting your username and password for your CodeCommit repository, you have the option to reset your Git credentials. To do so, initiate the credential reset with the command `git credential reject`. After executing this command, enter the following details when prompted:
      ```
      protocol=https
      host=git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      ```
    This will effectively clear any cached credentials for your CodeCommit repository, allowing you to enter new authentication details on your next Git operation.


6. **Bootstrapping and Deployment**:

    - Execute `cdk bootstrap` to prepare your AWS environment for the CDK deployment.
    - Run `cdk deploy --all` to deploy all stacks in your CDK application.
    - Upon initiating the deployment, check AWS CodePipeline for the status. The pipeline will initialize, but expect an initial failure due to the absence of the `DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable.

7. **Configure Build Environment**:

    - Locate the failed build within AWS CodeBuild projects and edit the environment configuration.
    - Add the missing `DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable with the appropriate value corresponding to your Route 53 domain setup.

8. **Update Pipeline Execution Role**:
    - Identify the IAM role used by CodePipeline for deployment, typically named `PipelineStack-PipelineBuildSynthCdkBuildProjectRole` or similar.
    - Attach the policy you created in step 1 to this role to ensure it has the required permissions.
    - This update grants the necessary access for the pipeline to execute actions on AWS resources during the deployment process.
