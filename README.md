## **Chad**: 
So you want to harness the power of the ultimate "alpha male" in the AWS realm? Enter awsChadâ€”a kickstart repo so ripped, it scoffs at the mere mention of average stacks.

## **Frontend**:

**HTMX:** Because React? That's what non-Chads use. HTMX pumps up your frontend game straight from AWS S3's gym and shows off its chiseled abs with AWS Cloudfront's lightning speed.

## **Backend**:

**Rust AWS Lambda:** Python? Pffft. Only Rust has the muscle for true Chads in the AWS Lambda dojo. Our API gateway's so flexed, it triggers Rust functions like a Chad spotting another free bench at the gym.
