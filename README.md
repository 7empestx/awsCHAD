## awsChad Deployment Guide:

This guide outlines the steps required for the seamless deployment of the awsChad project. Follow these prerequisites to prepare your environment:

1. **IAM User Configuration**:
   - Create an IAM user and generate access keys for CLI operations.
   - Attach the following policy to the user, ensuring to replace `<account-number>` with your actual AWS account number:
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Sid": "CDKBootstrap",
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": [
                     "cloudformation:*",
                     "ecr:*",
                     "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                     "iam:GetRole",
                     "iam:CreateRole",
                     "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                     "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                     "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                     "iam:DeleteRole",
                     "iam:PassRole",
                     "ssm:*",
                     "s3:*"
                 ],
                 "Resource": [
                     "arn:aws:iam::<account-number>:*",
                     "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:<account-number>:*",
                     "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:<account-number>:*",
                     "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:<account-number>:*",
                     "arn:aws:s3:::*"
                 ]
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
     This policy facilitates the `cdk bootstrap` command. Exercise caution as this policy is expansive; tailor it to your project's security needs. Safeguard your access keys and never commit them to any repositories.
   - Generate HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit and attach the `AWSCodeCommitPowerUser` policy to your IAM user for repository access.

2. **AWS CLI Installation**:
   - Follow the [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) documentation to install the AWS CLI.
   - Run `aws configure` to set up your IAM user's credentials in the CLI environment.

3. **Domain Registration**:
   - Register a domain with Amazon Route 53, referring to the [Route 53 Domain Registration Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html) for comprehensive guidance.

4. **Local Environment Setup**:
   - Inside the `cdk` directory of your project, create a `.env` file and specify your Route 53 domain:
     ```
     DOMAIN_NAME="YourChosenRoute53Domain.com"
     ```
     Replace `YourChosenRoute53Domain.com` with the domain you've registered, which will be integral to your deployment.

5. **CodeCommit Repository Setup**:
   - In the `us-east-1` region, establish a CodeCommit repository named `awsChad`. Should you opt for a different name or region, realign your pipeline stack's configurations accordingly.
   - Link the CodeCommit repository as a remote to your local repository and push your awsChad project using the HTTPS Git credentials established earlier.

Following this structured approach will help ensure that all necessary configurations and security precautions are in place for deploying your awsChad project.

## Harnessing the CDK:

**Before you command the CDK, ensure your AWS credentials and IAM policies are battle-ready.**

1. **Bootstrap Your AWS Environment**:
   Initiate your campaign with `cdk bootstrap`, laying the groundwork in AWS for your CDK application's siege.

2. **Deploy Your Application**:
   Post-bootstrap, marshal your stacks into AWS with `cdk deploy --all`. Verify that your AWS credentials are set and your IAM policies are appropriately armed for the deployment.
